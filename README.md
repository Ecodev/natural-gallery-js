All contributions are welcome, but keep in mind that the gallery will stay simple : too generalist or too specific features that could be done from your controllers won't be added.

## Found a bug ?

Create an issue where you report what you observe, what you expect to observe, and the context of usage, as well as your browser and it's version.

Consider a pull request, but create an issue before to expose your idea. Maybe the feature you would like to add is already on the pipeline or is intentionally not included for good reasons.
